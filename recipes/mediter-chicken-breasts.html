        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup olive oil</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon dried oregano, or more to taste</li>
            <li><&frac14; teaspoon dried thyme, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on all sides and place in a bowl or lidded container.<br>
                Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and thyme in a small bowl and pour marinade over chicken breasts.<br>
                Marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set one oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts into a baking dish and pour marinade on top.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken on the middle rack of the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 35 to 45 minutes, depending upon thickness.<br>
                Move baking dish to the top rack and broil chicken until well browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
