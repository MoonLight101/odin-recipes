            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Thin pancakes with milk are an English version of traditional fluffy Russian pancakes baked with yeast. <br>
                In Europe, pancakes look like thin, almost transparent napkins. <br>
                In France, they are called "crepes" and are served with a hundred different fillings.</p>
            <p>There are no special tricks in cooking: the more liquid the dough, the thinner the pancakes are. <br>
                Before pouring the first pancake, you should heat the frying pan well. <br>
                The pancake is ready when it begins to brown to crispy edges.</p>
