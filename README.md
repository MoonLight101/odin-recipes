# odin-recipes

This the first project of mine made with HTML - simple recipes website.

My current skillset: basics of Git and some basic HTML.

Self-reflection at the end of a project:

So, it was definitely fun, like building simplistic puzzle, stitching pieces together. Can't wait to come back to it later with new tools at my disposal.
Should be interesting to measure my progress in the future.
